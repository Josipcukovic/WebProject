                    <p> John Richard Deacon (born 19 August 1951) is an English retired musician, best known for being the bass guitarist for the rock band Queen. He composed several songs for the group—including Top 10 hits <b>"You're My Best Friend"</b>,<b> "Another One Bites the Dust"</b>, <b>"Back Chat"</b>, and <b>"I Want to Break Free"</b> and was involved in the band's financial management. Deacon grew up in Oadby, Leicestershire, playing bass in a local band, The Opposition, before moving to study electronics at Chelsea College, London. He joined Queen in 1971 on the strength of his musical and electronic skills, particularly the home-made <i>Deacy Amp</i> which guitarist <b>Brian May</b> used to create guitar orchestras throughout Queen's career.</p>
